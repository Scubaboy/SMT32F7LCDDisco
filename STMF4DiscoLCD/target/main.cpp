     * IMPORTANT NOTICE!
     *
     * The GUI task stack size might need to be increased if creating a new application.
     * The current value of 950 in this template is enough for the examples distributed with
     * TouchGFX, but is often insufficient for larger applications.
     * For reference, the touchgfx_2014 demo uses a stacksize of 2000.
     * If you experience inexplicable hard faults with your custom application, try increasing the
     * stack size.
     *
     * Also note that in FreeRTOS, stack size is in words. So a stack size of 950 actually consumes
     * 3800 bytes of memory. The configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE define in platform/os/FreeRTOSConfig.h configures
     * the total amount of memory available for FreeRTOS, including task stacks. This value is expressed
     * in BYTES, not words. So, with a stack size of 950, your total heap should be at least 4K.
